***READ ME***

YOU MUST HAVE THESE COLORS FOR EACH CHARACTER TO SEE THE MODS

Black = Hitfall Base (aka the green, pink, and black palette)
Orange* = Hitfall Half (aka the orange, blue, and teal color palette)

*Since Etalus doesn't have an orange skin, his Hitfall Half skin will show up on his blue slot


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Rivals 2\Rivals2\Content\Paks
2. Copy the Mods folder and paste it into the Paks folder
3. You are done. Boot up Rivals of Aether 2 to see the mods

WARNING
It is likely that the devs may update the number of color slots any character in future patches.
In the event this happens and  this modpack prevents you from booting up the game:

1. Single out the character(s) causing the game to crash
2. Contact Jaz.Wav (@jazsoundwav) on Discord so that the files for the characters crashing the game can be updated

New characters will also be added to this modpack as they are released. 

THANK YOU!
